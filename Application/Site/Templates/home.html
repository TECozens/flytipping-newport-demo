        <h3> The Law </h3>
        <p>The legislation tackling fly-tipping is to be found in the Environmental Protection Act 1990, as amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.</p>
        <p>The harshness of the penalty for fly-tipping depends on the seriousness of the offence, its impact on the environment and the cost of cleaning and dealing with any resulting pollution. Penalties can include a fine of Â£50,000 and / or 12 months in prison</p>

        <h3>What should you do if you discover fly-tipping?</h3>
        <p>Firstly, remember that your own safety is paramount. Fly-tipped waste may be hazardous. Do not open black bags, drums or containers. Even innocuous-looking waste can cover up or contain harmful items. Furthermore, fly-tippers are committing a crime, and are unlikely to welcome passers-by taking photos or recording details.</p>
